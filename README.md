# PAIR
PAIR (Platform Architecture Iterative Refinement) is a two-agent framework for designing software. One agent (Adder) proposes new features, while the other (Remover) trims unnecessary ones. Together, they iteratively refine features to evolve requirements, balance scope, and shape software design.
