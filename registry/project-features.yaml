    score: 4.1
    status: false
    adding:
      round: 3
      explaination: "This feature enhances story.002's progress tracking by adding motivational elements that keep students engaged and returning to the platform. It integrates directly with the existing Progress Dashboard (F004) and requires minimal backend infrastructure - primarily badge metadata and tracking logic. The visual rewards system addresses a common challenge in self-paced learning: maintaining motivation without instructor encouragement. Implementation is straightforward with predefined badge criteria and icon assets, fitting well within budget constraints. This complements the technical learning features with psychological engagement strategies proven effective for beginner learners."
    removing:
      round: 3
      explaination: "The Achievement Badges and Milestones System, while motivating, does not directly address any of the high-priority user stories (story.001, story.003, story.004 all priority 1). Given the 10-week timeline and limited budget constraints, this gamification feature consumes development resources without delivering core learning value. The platform already has F004 (Progress Tracking Dashboard) which addresses story.002 for motivation and progress visibility. F009 represents scope creep that adds complexity to the product without solving the fundamental problem of accessible Python practice through structured exercises."
